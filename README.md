Build a list of neighbors for each Zip code

Using Zip codes and their coordinates from Geonames (http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/) build a list of Zip code neighbors within a specified radius for faster lookup.

Data files for every country follow the same format so you are not limited to US Zip codes.
